Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: Two sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Labs: One session / week (9 weeks), 4 hours / session

Course Overview
---------------

This course introduces the theory and technology of micro/nano fabrication. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the subject, its content includes concepts from many disciplines in engineering (electrical, materials, mechanical, chemical) and science. In lecture, we will discuss the theory of basic processing techniques, such as diffusion, oxidation, photolithography, chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, etching, and metallization.

In the {{% resource_link 9fb8e576-41fc-f439-ef0c-45644f8a9fab "labs" %}} section of this course, we will be fabricating three different devices; an MOS capacitor, a microcantilever, and a microfluidic device. You will test each device in the lab and prepare a laboratory report for each device.

At the end of this course, one should have a good understanding of the various processing techniques used to micro/nano fabricate. One should understand the theory of the individual processes, how they are characterized, and the interrelationship of these processes when combined to fabricate devices.

Prerequisites
-------------

Permission of instructor.

Organization
------------

This course will meet for two 1-1/2 hour lectures per week. Laboratory sessions will begin on the second week of the term and continue until the end of the semester. Students will attend one four-hour laboratory session per week for 9 weeks.

Homework
--------

There will be 10 homework sets during the semester. The first eight homework sets will be based on the lecture material and will be due approximately one lecture after the material is presented. We strongly encourage students to work in teams with one set of solutions submitted by each team. As soon as possible, you should set up a homework team consisting of no more than four members. All team members must sign the completed solution and the final draft authors should be clearly identified at the beginning of the solution. Your signature is your bond that you have contributed significantly to the solutions. The final two homeworks will be based on attendance and participation (i.e. asking questions) in the last five lectures of the semester.

Exams
-----

There will be two 1-1/2 hour quizzes in class, scheduled for Lec #11 and Lec #23. In addition, there is one take-home quiz, due Lec #27.

Lab Report
----------

Each lab report (3) will be due after the conclusion of the corresponding lab module. The first submission of the IC Lab report will be graded based on writing and returned to you. You will re-submit a corrected IC Lab report for a final grade based on technical and writing content. The MEMS Lab report will be submitted after the second IC Lab report is returned to you. The MEMS Lab report will be graded based on technical and writing content. The Fluids Lab report will be graded only for technical content. We will distribute hand-outs that will describe in more detail the lab report requirements at the time of the labs.

Grades
------

The grades weigh laboratory and lecture content equally. The breakdown is listed below:

Policy for Academic Conduct
---------------------------

The homework, quizzes, and lab reports, which are required in this course, have the primary function of helping you learn the material. The secondary function of these assignments is to aid the staff in assessing your understanding of the material, in particular when the time comes to provide a final grade for the course. To this end, the extent to which you collaborate with your colleagues in preparing this material must be understood and agreed upon by both the students and the staff. The following is our policy regarding permissible levels of collaboration. This is intended to provide guidance, but please recognize that a violation of this policy will be dealt with in the most severe manner available to the staff.

The homework assignments are intended nearly exclusively to serve as a learning tool. As such, we are comfortable with collaboration amongst students on the solving of these assignments provided all collaborators are equal contributors to the solution of the problems.

The in-class quiz and the take home quiz are important to the staff in assessing your performance. Collaboration in taking these exams is not permitted. The take home exam must be exclusively your own work.

The lab reports are intended to pull-together the material from the lectures. You will work in groups to fabricate devices and collect data. However, the data analysis, results and conclusions presented in the report must be exclusively your own. The use of reports written in previous terms is strictly forbidden. The staff will be available to assist you in the preparation of these reports.

Laboratory Groups
-----------------

Laboratory groups will consist of six or fewer students who will meet for 9 lab sessions during the semester. The possible times available are listed in the course information handout.

Laboratory Rules
----------------

1.  **Attendance** - Show up on time for your lab sessions. If you are sick or for some reason you have to miss your lab session, contact your teaching assistant prior to the start of the lab session.
2.  **Signing In and Out - MTL Identification Card** - For each lab session, you **must** obtain a MTL Identification Card from a TA. ID cards are **required** for entering the lab. When you finish your lab session, sign-out of the lab and please return your ID card.
3.  **Coats / Backpacks / Storage** - Store your coats and any personal belongings in the second floor lockers. **Do not leave any valuable item(s) in lockers!**
4.  **What to Bring?** - ICL/TRL, are **class 10** and **class 100** clean-rooms respectively. You should not bring anything into these clean-rooms (including pens, paper, notebooks etc.). Special clean-room pens and paper are available inside the room.
5.  **What to Wear?** - No shorts, skirts, and / or barefeet (exposed legs or skin) are allowed in the lab. Bring an extra pair of shoes for changing if you wear snow boots. You must protect yourself and the laboratory.

Questions, comments should be directed to the Teaching Assistants or Laboratory Instructor.
